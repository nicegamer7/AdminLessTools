# AdminLessTools
A repository for tools which don't need Administrator privileges (Windows).

## Fonter
This tool is used to install fonts temporarily. The fonts installed using this tool will be erased at each reboot. Simply put your font(s) in the same folder as the tool, or in a subfolder, and run the batch file. Unfortunatly at this time, it uses a closed source binary to add the font files to the system. Will work on a solution to that.
